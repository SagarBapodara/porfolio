> - Integrated third-party APIs and web services to enhance website functionality and facilitate data exchange.
> - Conducted extensive testing and debugging procedures to ensure the reliability of cloud applications.

**Undergraduate Researcher (AI-ML) & Analytics @ IITRAM, Ahmedabad (_Aug 2021 - May 2022_)**
> - Employed advanced machine learning audio processing and computer vision techniques to develop a siren sound detection, achieving 95.7% testing accuracy. Deployed the model on Raspberry Pi interfaced with a sound sensor.
> - Utilized deep learning-based object detection frameworks (versions of YOLO) & and Darknet53 architecture to develop a custom vehicle detection & and classification model. (Accuracy ~ 69%)
> - Designed a queuing theory-based cost function to develop & and optimize the traffic light control (TLC) algorithm. Developed the TLC algorithm, and performed optimization & and case-wise simulations.

**Intern - Data Science & Analytics @ Reliance Industries Limited (_May 2021 - Aug 2021_)**
> - Performed in-depth statistical data analysis and developed PowerBI dashboards for insights.
> - Formulated & improved time series models; 87% for petroleum production & 75% for waste segregation.
> - Implemented a web-based application for continuous monitoring, utilizing data from over 50 sensors.

**Web Development Intern @ Youth India Foundation (_Nov 2020 - Feb 2021_)**
> - Built an online end-to-end seamless onboarding system for new registrations during events. Handled server load-balancing during peak usage.
> - Extended website's compatibility to mobiles, and tablets by making components responsive & enabling caching. Led a team 25+ of web developers, graphic designers, and social media managers.
> - Developed designs for various community websites under the organization.

**Resarch Intern (Machine Learning) @ Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (_May 2020 - Jul 2020_)**
> - Worked on the project ‘Computer-Vision based Sketch Image Retrieval’ using advanced machine learning techniques and OpenCV library. 
> - Implemented an advanced version of the triplet loss function to minimize the losses in the actual and produced sketched image. Minimized the reconstruction losses up to 40% and improved the mean average precision score by approx—15%.
> - Assisted with the implementation of deep sketch hashing and adversarial autoencoders on the dataset for evaluation and assessment purposes with the proposed methodologies.
